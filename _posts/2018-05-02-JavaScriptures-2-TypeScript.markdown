The second in our JavaScriptures series on the Artsy [omakase][omakase]. This one is a deep dive in TypeScript with
a minor-focus on working with React. We run through a series of excercises you can run [through yourself
here][exer].

It's ran by [@alloy][alloy] and [Sarah Scott][ss] and covers compilation, errors, default types, interfaces,
inference, generics and how they all come together in your tools.
