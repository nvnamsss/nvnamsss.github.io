We are slowly trying to do high-level code-review views for all of our iOS apps. So far, we've covered [Eidolon](/blog/2016/01/14/eidolon-code-review/) and [Emergence](/blog/2015/11/05/Emergence-Code-Review/). Folio is an app that's shipped to the App Store in early 2012, it's used by our Partners to showcase their works offline, at fairs and on the go. If you want the full spiel, check out [this microsite](http://folio.artsy.net).

This video talks through a lot of the critical codepaths that go from the App's launch to sending an email, which is the main use-case for the app. We have another video coming up which exclusively covers how Folio does sync between the Artsy API and the app.
