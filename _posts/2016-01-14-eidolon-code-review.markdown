[Eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon) is the third app from Artsy's mobile team, and it was the [first to be developed totally in the open](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/). It's often used as a reference for what an app written in Swift, or written using FRP, should look like. Given how interested the community seems to be around the app, it's about time we did a walkthrough of the code.

This was done as a part of the engineering team's weekly lunch and learn sessions, where we get together and share what we've been working on. Since most of you aren't Artsy engineers, and so you can't ask questions in-person, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/issues/new) to ask for any clarifications.
