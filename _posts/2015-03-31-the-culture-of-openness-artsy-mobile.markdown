Recently, the Artsy Mobile team had the pleasure of working together on [an article](http://www.objc.io/issue-22/artsy.html) for [objc.io](http://www.objc.io), an online publication dedicated to in-depth articles about iOS and OS X development. Each monthly issue consists of several articles centered around a theme—past issues include [Testing](http://www.objc.io/issue-15/), [Animations](http://www.objc.io/issue-12/) and [Swift](http://www.objc.io/issue-16/). objc.io’s latest issue, [iOS at Scale](http://www.objc.io/issue-22), features articles by a handful of developers about how they approach iOS development at their respective companies. Our contribution to the issue is a collaboratively-written article by and about Artsy’s Mobile team from the angle of Artsy's focus on the core value of openness that is foundational to how we (and the greater Artsy team) work.

As our article puts it:
> Our team intrinsically believes in the ideas of open source. Though our individual motivations vary — from a conviction in the power of education to a determination to help others see from giants’ shoulders — we all maintain the value of open source.

iOS at Artsy is characterized by a culture of open source stewardship. Although our team is small, our contributions to the Cocoa developer community are significant. We hope our article sheds some light on our development and testing practices while also providing a high-level look into our team’s philosophy.
