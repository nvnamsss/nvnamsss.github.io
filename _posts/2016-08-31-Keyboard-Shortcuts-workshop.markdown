Hey all, I was asked to talk internally about ways in which anyone can improve their day-to-day computer usage. For me, using keyboard shortcuts shows a greater level of control of your machine - and more importantly can be considerably faster.

I have all of my notes, annotated with images inside a personal GitHub repo: [orta/keyboard_shortcuts](https://github.com/orta/keyboard_shortcuts). We covered:

* Pressing menu items via keyboard
* Window Management
* Text Management, e.g. jumping between words etc.
* Searching for text 
* Taking Screenshots
* Slack and Chrome
* Using a Window Manager and Clipboard History Manager
