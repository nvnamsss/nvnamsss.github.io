Conditional types probably aren't something you'll write every day, but you might end up using them indirectly all
the time. That's because they're great for 'plumbing' or 'framework' code, for dealing with API boundaries and
other behind-the-scenes kinda stuff. So, dear reader, read on! It's always good to learn how the sausage is made.
Then you can make sausage of your own.

Typewurst! üå≠

_Note: This is a straightforward adaptation of a 35-minute presentation given at
[Futurice London's TypeScript Night meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Futurice-London-Beer-Tech/events/255295412/),
and therefore provides more context than an ordinary blog post might. I hope a lot of that context is interesting
and useful even for seasoned TypeScript developers. If you'd prefer a no-frills experience, check out the
[TypeScript 2.8 Release notes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html) ._

## Your first conditional type

Here's some plain JavaScript

```ts
function process(text) {
  return text && text.replace(/f/g, "p")
}

process("foo").toUpperCase()
```

Reading the code, it's clear to a human that the `.toUpperCase()` method call is safe. We can tell that whenever a
string is passed in to `process`, a string will be returned.

But notice that we could also pass something like `null` into the function, in which case `null` would be returned.
Then calling `.toUpperCase()` on the result would be an error.

Let's add basic types to this function so we can let TypeScript worry about whether we are using it safely or not.

```ts
function process(text: string | null): string | null {
  return text && text.replace(/f/g, "p")
}
```

Seems sensible. What happens if we try to use it like before?

```ts
//            ‚åÑ Type Error! :(
process("foo").toUpperCase()
```

TypeScript complains because it thinks that the result of `process("foo")` might be `null`, even though we clever
humans know that it won't be. It can't figure out the runtime semantics of the function on its own.

One way of helping TS understand the function better is to use 'overloading'. Overloading involves providing
multiple type signatures for a single function, and letting TypeScript figure out which one to use in any given
context.

```ts
function process(text: null): null;
function process(text: string): string;
function process(text: any) {
  ...
}
```

Here we've said that if we pass a `string`, it returns a `string`, and if we pass `null`, it returns `null`. _(The
`any` type is ignored but still needs to be there for some reason_ ü§∑‚ÄçÔ∏è*)*

That works nicely:

```ts
// All clear!
process("foo").toUpperCase()
//           ‚åÑ Type Error! :)
process(null).toUpperCase()
```

But there's another use case that doesn't work:

```ts
declare const maybeFoo: string | null

//      ‚åÑ Type Error! :(
process(maybeFoo)
```

TypeScript won't let us pass something that is of type `string | null` because it's not smart enough to collapse
the overloaded signatures when that's possible. So we can either add yet another overload signature for the
`string | null` case, or we can be like <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-family: sans-serif;">(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ
‚îª‚îÅ‚îª</span> and switch to using **conditional types**.

```ts
function process<T extends string | null>(
  text: T
): T extends string ? string : null {
  ...
}
```

Here we've introduced a type variable `T` for the `text` parameter. We can then use `T` as part of a conditional
return type: `T extends string ? string : null`. You probably noticed that this looks just like a ternary
expression! Indeed, it's doing the same kind of thing, but within the type system at compile time.

And that takes care of all our use cases:

```ts
typeof process("foo") // => string
typeof process(null) // => null
typeof process(maybeFoo) // => string | null
```

So that's what a conditional type is! A kind of ternary type expression. It always has this form:

```
A extends B ? C : D
```

`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` can be any old type expressions, but all the important stuff is happening on the left there.
In the `A extends B` condition.

## Assignability

This `extends` keyword is the heart of a conditional type. `A extends B` means precisely that any value of type `A`
can safely be assigned to a variable of type `B`. In type system jargon we can say that "A is _assignable_ to B".

```ts
declare const a: A
const b: B = a
// type check succeeds only if A is assignable to B
```

TypeScript decides which types are assignable to each other using an approach called 'structural typing'. This kind
of type system started appearing in mainstream languages relatively recently (in the last 10 years or so), and
might be a little counterintuitive if you come from a Java or C# background.

You may have heard of 'duck typing' in relation to dynamically-typed languages. The phrase 'duck typing' comes from
the proverb

> If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.

In duck typing, you judge a thing by how it behaves, rather than what it is called or who its parents are. It's a
kind of meritocracy. Structural typing is a way of applying that same idea to a static compile-time type system.

So TypeScript only cares about what types can do, not what they are called or where they exist in a type hierarchy.

Take this simple example:

```ts
class A {}
class B {}

const b: B = new A() // ‚úî all good
const a: A = new B() // ‚úî all good

new A() instanceof B // => false
```

TypeScript is happy treating two completely unrelated classes as equivalent because they have the same _structure_
and the same _capabilities_. Meanwhile, when checking the types at runtime, we discover that they are actually not
equivalent.

This is a notable example of where the semantics of TypeScript are at odds with JavaScript. It might seem like a
problem, but in practice structural typing is a lot more flexible than Java-esque 'nominal' typing, where names and
hierarchy matter. The two aren't mutually exclusive, however. Some languages, like Scala and Flow, allow you to mix
and match to suit particular problems.

Aside from that, the way that assignability works with structural typing is very intuitive.

```ts
interface Shape {
  color: string
}

class Circle {
  color: string
  radius: number
}

// ‚úî All good! Circles have a color
const shape: Shape = new Circle()
// ‚úò Type error! Not all shapes have a radius!
const circle: Circle = shape
```

Speaking structurally we can say that `A extends B` is a lot like '`A` is a superset of `B`', or, to be more
verbose, '`A` has all of `B`'s properties, _and maybe some more_'.

There's one minor caveat though, and that's with 'literal' types. In TypeScript you can use literal values of
primitive types as types themselves.

```ts
let fruit: "banana" = "banana"

// Type Error! "apple" is not assignable to "banana"
fruit = "apple"
```

The string `"banana"` doesn't have more properties than any other `string`. But the type `"banana"` is still more
_specific_ than the type `string`.

So another way to think of `A extends B` is like '`A` is a possibly-more-specific version of `B`'.

Which brings us to 'top' and 'bottom' types: the _least_ and _most_ specific types, respectively.

In type theory a 'top' type is one which all other types are assignable to. It is the type you use to say "I have
absolutely no information about what this value is". Think of it as the union of all possible types:

```ts
type Top = string | number | {foo: Bar} | Baz[] | ... | ‚àû
```

TypeScript has two top types: `any` and `unknown`.

- Using `any` is like saying "I have no idea what this value looks like. So, TypeScript, please assume I'm using it
  correctly, and don't complain if anything I do seems dangerous".
- Using `unknown` is like saying "I have no idea what this value looks like. So, TypeScript, please make sure I
  check what it is capable of at run time."

A 'bottom' type is one which no other types are assignable to, and that no values can be an instance of. Think of
it as the empty union type:

```ts
type Bottom = ‚àÖ
```

TypeScript has one bottom type: `never`. That's a nice descriptive name because it literally means _this can never
happen_.

Top and bottom types are useful to know about when working with conditional types. `never` is especially useful
when using conditional types to refine unions...

## Refining unions with distributive conditional types

Conditional types let you filter out particular members of a union type. To illustrate, let's say we have a union
type called `Animal`:

```ts
type Animal = Lion | Zebra | Tiger | Shark
```

And imagine that we needed to write a function that used only those animals which are also cats. We might write
some helper type called `ExtractCat` to do that:

```ts
type ExtractCat<A> = A extends { meow(): void } ? A : never

type Cat = ExtractCat<Animal>
// => Lion | Tiger
```

_I know lions and tigers don't meow, but how cute would it be if they did_ ^\_^

This seemed vague and magical to me at first. Let's see what TypeScript is doing under the hood when it evaluates
`ExtractCat<Animal>`.

First, it applies `ExtractCat` recursively to all the members of `Animal`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
type Cat =
  | ExtractCat<Lion>
  | ExtractCat<Zebra>
  | ExtractCat<Tiger>
  | ExtractCat<Shark>
```

Then it evaluates the conditional types:

```ts
type Cat = Lion | never | Tiger | never
```

And then something fun happens... Remember that no values can ever be of type `never`? That makes it totally
meaningless to include `never` in a union type, so TypeScript just gets rid of it.

```ts
type Cat = Lion | Tiger
```

The TypeScript jargon for this kind of conditional type is **distributive conditional type**.

That 'distribution', where the union is unrolled recursively, only happens when the thing on the left of the
`extends` keyword is a plain type variable. We'll see what that means and how to work around it in the next
section.

## A real use-case for distributive conditional types.

A while ago I was building a Chrome extension. It had a 'background' script and a 'view' script that ran in
different execution contexts. They needed to communicate and share state, and the only way to do that is via
serializable message passing. I took inspiration from Redux and defined a global union of interfaces called
`Action` to model the messages that I wanted to be able to pass between the contexts.

```ts
type Action =
  | {
      type: "INIT"
    }
  | {
      type: "SYNC"
    }
  | {
      type: "LOG_IN"
      emailAddress: string
    }
  | {
      type: "LOG_IN_SUCCESS"
      accessToken: string
    }
// ...
```

And then there was a global `dispatch` function that I could use directly to broadcast messages across contexts

```ts
declare function dispatch(action: Action): void

// ...

dispatch({
  type: "INIT"
})

// ...

dispatch({
  type: "LOG_IN",
  emailAddress: "david.sheldrick@artsy.net"
})

// ...

dispatch({
  type: "LOG_IN_SUCCESS",
  accessToken: "038fh239h923908h"
})
```

This API is typesafe and it plays well with my IDE's autocomplete and I could have left it there. I could have
moved on to other things.

But there's this little voice inside my head. I think most developers have this voice.

We've all been there.

I wanted the dispatch function to work like this:

```ts
// first argument is the 'type'
// second is any extra parameters
dispatch("LOG_IN_SUCCESS", {
  accessToken: "038fh239h923908h"
})
```

Deriving the type for that first argument is easy enough.

```ts
type ActionType = Action["type"]
// => "INIT" | "SYNC" | "LOG_IN" | "LOG_IN_SUCCESS"
```

But the type of the second argument _depends on_ the first argument. We can use a type variable to model that
dependency.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
declare function dispatch<T extends ActionType>(
  type: T,
  args: ExtractActionParameters<Action, T>
): void
```

_Woah woah woah, what's this_ `ExtractActionParameters` _voodoo?_

It's a conditional type of course! Here's a first attempt at implementing it:

```ts
type ExtractActionParameters<A, T> = A extends { type: T } ? A : never
```

This is a lot like the `ExtractCat` example from before, where we were were refining the `Animals` union by
searching for something that can `meow()`. Here, we're refining the `Action` union type by searching for an
interface with a particular `type` property. Let's see if it works:

```ts
type Test = ExtractActionParameters<Action, "LOG_IN">
// => { type: "LOG_IN", emailAddress: string }
```

Almost there! We don't want to keep the `type` field after extraction because then we would still have to specify
it when calling `dispatch`. And that would somewhat defeat the purpose of this entire exercise.

We can omit the `type` field by combining a **mapped type** with a conditional type and the `keyof` operator.

A **mapped type** lets you create a new interface by 'mapping' over a union of keys. You can get a union of keys
from an existing interface by using the `keyof` operator. And finally, you can remove things from a union using a
conditional type. Here's how they play together (with some inline test cases for illustration):

```ts
type ExcludeTypeKey<K> = K extends "type" ? never : K

type Test = ExcludeTypeKey<"emailAddress" | "type" | "foo">
// => "emailAddress" | "foo"

// here's the mapped type
type ExcludeTypeField<A> = { [K in ExcludeTypeKey<keyof A>]: A[K] }

type Test = ExcludeTypeField<{ type: "LOG_IN"; emailAddress: string }>
// => { emailAddress: string }
```

Then we can use `ExcludeTypeField` to redefine `ExtractActionParameters`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
type ExtractActionParameters<A, T> = A extends { type: T }
  ? ExcludeTypeField<A>
  : never
```

And now the new version of `dipsatch` is typesafe!

```ts
// All clear! :)
dispatch("LOG_IN_SUCCESS", {
  accessToken: "038fh239h923908h"
})

dispatch("LOG_IN_SUCCESS", {
  // Type Error! :)
  badKey: "038fh239h923908h"
})

// Type Error! :)
dispatch("BAD_TYPE", {
  accessToken: "038fh239h923908h"
})
```

_Try it in the TypeScript playground_ </a>

But there's one more very serious problem to address: If the action has no extra parameters, I still have to pass a
second empty argument.

```ts
dispatch("INIT", {})
```

That's four whole wasted characters! Cancel my meetings and tell my partner not to wait up tonight! We need to
_fix. this_.

The na√Øve thing to do would be to make the second argument optional. That would be unsafe because, e.g. it would
allow us to dispatch a `"LOG_IN"` action without specifying an `emailAddress`.

Instead, let's overload the `dispatch` function.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// And let's say that any actions that don't require
// extra parameters are 'simple' actions.
declare function dispatch(type: SimpleActionType): void
// this signature is just like before
declare function dispatch<T extends ActionType>(
  type: T,
  args: ExtractActionParameters<Action, T>
): void

type SimpleActionType = ExtractSimpleAction<Action>['type']
```

How can we define this `ExtractSimpleAction` conditional type? We know that if we remove the `type` field from an
action and the result is an empty interface, then that is a simple action. So something like this might work

```ts
type ExtractSimpleAction<A> = ExcludeTypeField<A> extends {} ? A : never
```

Except that doesn't work. `ExcludeTypeField<A> extends {}` is always going to be true, because `{}` is like a top
type for interfaces. _Pretty much everything_ is more specific than `{}`.

We need to swap the arguments around:

```ts
type ExtractSimpleAction<A> = {} extends ExcludeTypeField<A> ? A : never
```

Now if `ExcludeTypeField<A>` is empty, the condition will be true, otherwise it will be false.

But this still doesn't work! On-the-ball readers might remember this:

-- Me, in the previous section

Type variables are always defined in a generic parameter list, delimited by `<` and `>`. e.g.

```ts
type Blah<These, Are, Type, Variables> = ...

function blah<And, So, Are, These>() {
  ...
}
```

And if you want a conditional type to distribute over a union, the union a) needs to have been bound to a type
variable, and b) that variable needs to appear alone to the left of the `extends` keyword.

e.g. this is a distributive conditional type:

```ts
type Blah<Var> = Var extends Whatever ? A : B
```

and these are not:

```ts
type Blah<Var> = Foo<Var> extends Whatever ? A : B
type Blah<Var> = Whatever extends Var ? A : B
```

When I discovered this limitation I thought that it exposed a fundamental shortcoming in the way distributive
conditional types work under the hood. I thought it might be some kind of concession to algorithmic complexity. I
thought that my use case was too advanced, and that TypeScript had just thrown its hands up in the air and said,
"Sorry mate, you're on your own".

But it turns out I was wrong. It is just a pragmatic language design decision to avoid extra syntax, and you can
work around it easily:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
type ExtractSimpleAction<A> = A extends any
  ? {} extends ExcludeTypeField<A>
    ? A
    : never
  : never
```

All we did is wrap the meat of our logic in a flimsy tortilla of inevitability, since the outer condition
`A extends any` will, of course, always be true.

And finally we can delete those four characters üéâüï∫üèºüíÉüèΩüéà

```ts
dispatch("INIT")
```

That's one yak successfully shaved ‚úî

TypeScript provides a couple of built-in types that we could have used in this section:

```ts
// Exclude from U those types that are assignable to T
type Exclude<U, T> = U extends T ? never : U

// Extract from U those types that are assignable to T
type Extract<U, T> = U extends T ? U : never
```

e.g. instead of defining `ExcludeTypeField` like this:

```ts
type ExcludeTypeField<A> = { [K in ExcludeTypeKey<keyof A>]: A[K] }
```

we could have done this:

```ts
type ExcludeTypeField<A> = { [K in Exclude<keyof A, "type">]: A[K] }
```

And instead of defining `ExtractActionParameters` like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
type ExtractActionParameters<A, T> = A extends { type: T }
  ? ExcludeTypeField<A>
  : never
```

we could have done this:

```ts
type ExtractActionParameters<A, T> = ExcludeTypeField<Extract<A, { type: T }>>
```

## üí° Exercise for the intrepid reader

Notice that this still works.

```ts
dispatch("INIT", {})
```

Use what you've learned so far to make it an error to supply a second argument for 'simple' actions.

## Destructuring types with `infer`

Conditional types have another trick up their sleeve: the `infer` keyword. It can be used anywhere in the type
expression to the right of the `extends` keyword. It gives a name to whichever type would appear in that place.
e.g.

```ts
type Unpack<A> = A extends Array<infer E> ? E : A

type Test = Unpack<Apple[]>
// => Apple
type Test = Unpack<Apple>
// => Apple
```

It handles ambiguity gracefully:

```ts
type Stairs = Unpack<Apple[] | Pear[]>
// => Apple | Pear
```

You can even use `infer` multiple times.

```ts
type Flip<T> = T extends [infer A, infer B] ? [B, A] : never
type Stairs = Flip<[Pear, Apple]>
// => [Apple, Pear]

type Union<T> = T extends [infer A, infer A] ? A : never
type Stairs = Union<[Apple, Pear]>
// => Apple | Pear
```

## Other built-in conditional types

We've already seen `Exclude` and `Extract`, and TypeScript provides a few other conditional types out of the box.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Exclude null and undefined from T
type NonNullable<T> =
  T extends null | undefined ? never : T

// Obtain the parameters of a function type in a tuple
type Parameters<T> =
  T extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never

// Obtain the parameters of a constructor function type in a tuple
type ConstructorParameters<T> =
  T extends new (...args: infer P) => any ? P : never

// Obtain the return type of a function type
type ReturnType<T> =
  T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any

// Obtain the return type of a constructor function type
type InstanceType<T> =
  T extends new (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : any
```
