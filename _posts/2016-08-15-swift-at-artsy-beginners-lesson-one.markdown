Last August, Orta and I [led a course at Artsy][course] to teach our colleagues Swift. There were two parallel groups of learners: a "beginners" group who had never coded before, and an "informed" group who already knew how to code. This year, we're leading the course again with a slight twist: we're repeating the course for absolute beginners, and we're introduce a new course for anyone who completed last year's beginner course. 

We're really excited both to help new colleagues take their first steps into programming, and to help returning colleagues continue their journey.

Today was lesson one of the beginner group, and I have a [screen recording][youtube] of my walkthrough of [lesson one's material][github].
