React Native has a lot of buzz around it. It is some serious and cool tech, yet can feel like a big departure from
your native iOS codebase. At Artsy, we like it. It has been the right choice for us. We've [documented][] [our][]
[journey][] and [reasoning][] quite extensively, but naturally, developers around the world are still wondering
whether the trade-offs make sense to _their_ team, and _their_ situation.

Enter [Artsy x React-Native][axrn].

Who better to partner with than Facebook? We're bringing a day full of hands-on informative insight and practical
play. With the focus on what building world class applications with RN can be like.

We'll demo, through talks and workshops, how to add React Native bit by bit to an existing codebase, set your
tooling up for success, and create solid animations.

We want [Artsy x React-Native][axrn] to be about getting you up to speed with the framework, so you can make your
own decisions going forward.
