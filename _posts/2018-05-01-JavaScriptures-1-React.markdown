We're a growing engineering team, and that tends to mean that people move towards being more specialized. This is
great for an individual's technical depth, but can weaken their breadth of knowledge on new technology. We want to
encourage the growth of both within our engineering team. To address this our front-end engineers worked together to
run a series of workshops for the whole engineering team.

We called this JavaScriptures, 6 workshop-style deep dives into the major parts of the [Artsy JavaScript
omakase][omakase]. They are: React, TypeScript, Styled Components, Relay and Redux, Babel and Webpack. Today I'm
posting the [recording][recording] and [slides][slides] from a deep dive into React hosted by [Luc Succes][luc] and
myself.
