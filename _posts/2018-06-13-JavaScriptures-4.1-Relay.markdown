The fourth in our JavaScriptures series on the Artsy [omakase][omakase]. This talk is the first part on state
management inside JavaScript projects. In this talk [Alloy][] covers the basics of how we handle interacting with
external state with our GraphQL API [metaphysics][].

[Alloy][] takes our [existing demo application][demo] from the previous JavaScriptures and converts it to use Relay
with all of the Artsy tooling.
