Dear Artsy Engineer:

What follows is a template for a great blog post – all you need to do is copy this file into the `_posts` directory and rename it with the current date and post title. Then go through the template and replace THINGS_WITH_CAPS like you're playing mad libs. If a sentence doesn't fit, just delete it. Short blog posts are good blog posts.

Then send a PR, and congrats! You've written a blog post.

FRIENDLY_SALUTATION! My name is MY_NAME and I work on the TEAM_NAME at Artsy. Recently, we faced PROBLEM but couldn't use OBVIOUS_SOLUTION because REASON. Luckily, with some help from COLLEAGUE_NAME and some clever thinking, we figured how how to fix PROBLEM.

We thought about using OBVIOUS_SOLUTION but ran into trouble. We tried to fix the problem using TECHNIQUE but it didn't work because REASON. We've OPENED_ISSUE/SENT_PR/CONTACTED_MAINTAINER to resolve this, but in the meantime we had to ship PRODUCT_NAME.

Instead, we used DIFFERENT_APPROACH_NAME. This worked for us because of REASON. It was CHALLENGING/REWARDING/FRUSTRATING to work on, but I learned the following:

- LIST_OF_WHAT_I_LEARNED

In the future, I would do THIS_THING differently. I'm glad I was able to learn with COLLEAGUE_NAME about ENGINEERING_PRACTICE – the code is available at LINK_TO_PULL_REQUEST_OR_SOMETHING. HAVE_A_NICE_DAY_OR_EQUIVALENT.
