Dear Artsy Engineer:

What follows is a template for a great blog post, on the longer side. You need to copy this file into the `_posts` directory and rename it with the current date and post title. Then go through and write a few paragraphs for each of the sections described below.

Finally, send a PR and congrats! You've written a blog post.

An introduction is a 1-2 paragraph overview of what the blog post talks about. It should describe the technologies related to the blog post, but not explain them. Write this last.

There are a lot of different ways to structure the main body of a blog post, but a straightforward approach is to have a paragraph or two dedicated to the following (in order):

- Problem statement (a feature request, a bug report, an outage).
- Context (anything the reader needs to know beyond the problem statement).
- Initial Attempt.
  - Describe your initial approach and why you thought it would work.
  - Then, explain why it didn't suit your needs.
- Subsequent Attempt.
  - Describe what you learned from the initial attempt and how it helped lead you to what did finally work.
  - Explain what surprised you about the solution you ended up using.
  - Describe your thought process: how did you look for a solution to the problem? Who helped you? What was something that initially confused you and how did you overcome that confusion?
- Evaluate the solution in terms of how well it applies to the problem statement.

Spend most of your time writing this section.

If starting is difficult, just write out some links to PRs, issues, Slack messages, or libraries. Write a rough problem statement, then send a work-in-progress pull request so others can help get you unstuck.

The conclusion of your post should mirror the introduction: an overview of the post that describes (but does not explain) the technologies involved. Repetition helps emphasize your points, so make sure to re-state any high-level takeaways from the main body of your post. Maybe a list makes sense, or a paragraph.

The conclusion should also include links to pull requests or issues related to the post, as well as provide any thanks you'd like to extend to your colleagues or community members.
