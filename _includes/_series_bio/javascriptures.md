### JavaScriptures

We're a growing engineering team, and that tends to mean that people move towards being more specialized. This is
great for an individual's technical _depth_, but can weaken their breadth of knowledge on new technologies. We want
to encourage the growth of both within our engineering team. To address this, our front-end engineers worked
together to run a series of workshops for the whole engineering team to align on the what, why, and how of our
frontend tech stack.

We called this JavaScriptures, 6 workshop-style deep dives into the major parts of the [Artsy JavaScript
omakase][omakase]. You can see the YouTube playlist of [them all here][yt].
