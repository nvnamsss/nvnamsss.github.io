### The Artsy Omakase

We gave our JavaScript stack for web and iOS the name "Artsy Omakase" and it represents using:

- React
- Relay
- GraphQL
- Styled Components
- TypeScript
- Storybooks
- Jest
- VS Code

To create a coherent open source development environment with great developer tools that makes it really easy to
fall into the pit of success on large projects. You can watch an overview video from @orta
[on Artsy's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3loALSVQM) from our React Native conference in 2018.
